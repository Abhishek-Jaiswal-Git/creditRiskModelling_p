__Credit Risk Modeling using XGBoost__  
This project involves the development of a credit risk model using XGBoost. The model assesses the credit risk of loan applicants, assisting financial institutions in making informed decisions about loan approvals. The project includes data preprocessing, model training and evaluation for model inference.  
The final model achieved an F1 score of 0.85, demonstrating its accuracy in predicting credit risk. The project utilizes Python, Scikit-Learn, and advanced data preprocessing techniques to ensure high performance and reliability.
